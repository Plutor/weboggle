* Move board numbers up, convert old boards, migrate them in, rerun report (whee)
* Backspace key in IE

* Better graphs for WEBoggle report
* Filter missed words server side?
* No blinking/hammering server when broken (detect HTTP errors)
* No name cookie should redirect to name page
* Get list-in-progress on reload (prevent data loss if you mistakenly hit F5)
* "-1 seconds to next game"

Long term:
* Path algorithm is slow and ugly
* Unique Google-like user_ids for anonymous stats tracking?
